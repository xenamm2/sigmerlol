## About this site

[eaglercraft.github.io](../game) is a website intended to make it easy for people to play eaglercraft online. However, if you cannot access this website due to a firewall (i.e., school firewall), then feel free to download the file from the official [github page](https://github.com/LAX1DUDE/eaglercraft/tree/main/stable-download). The html file marked "Offline_Download_Version.html" is the official download for the game client, and download "stable-download.zip" to host a server. For more information about hosting a server, watch [this video](https://youtube.com/watch?v=Zsnv8YskjMA) by [LAX1DUDE](https://github.com/LAX1DUDE).

## Why this even exists

even though github.io is blocked by many school firewalls, I wanted to provide an option for people who, 1. could not afford real minecraft and 2. don't have enough space on their device for this. But of course, if you can afford a non-pirated copy of minecraft, go to [minecraft.net] (minecraft.net) and blow your money on some block game.

## List of servers

Now, the moment you start eaglercraft, your gonna realize there is no singleplayer option. This means that you must play on a server. However, after checking all of your favorite server ips, you realize that none of them work. Fortunely, you can visit [this forum](https://g.eags.us/eaglercraft/servers/viewforum.php?f=3) to look at some of the servers people have hosted. Here are some of my personal favorites:

wss://mc.primitt.tk/survival
wss://mc.b2server.tk
wss://new-creative-server.adamfrizit.repl.co/server

notice how each of these addresses is preceded by wss://. So, unlike a url, you musn't be lazy and not type it out.
